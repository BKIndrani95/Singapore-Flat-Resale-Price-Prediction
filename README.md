# Singapore-Flat-Resale-Price-Prediction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model. Predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat. The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and it can be challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. There are many factors that can affect resale prices, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. A predictive model can help to overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors. Data Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn helps to create multiple charts.
